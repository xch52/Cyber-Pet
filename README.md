Cyber Pet is a blockchain game.   Rather than a ‘game’, it is a platform for collecting, raffle, auctioning and selling virtual pets.   ‘Blockchain’ is the technical basis for the operation of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.
Although our pets are not digital currencies, they can provide the same security: each pet is unique and 100% owned by you.   It cannot be copied, taken away, or destroyed.
It is precisely because of this feature of our pets that people can draw the most popular pet in CyberPet and put it on the market for auction, which can earn a lot of money.
